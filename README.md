Objective: The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for classifying NBA players based on their performance statistics. The project segments players into distinct categories reflecting playing styles, roles, or potential contract values using various statistical inputs.

Data Source: The dataset, titled 'NBA-Player-Stats.csv,' includes performance metrics such as points per game, rebounds, assists, shooting accuracy, and minutes played.

Tools and Technologies-
Python: Main programming language for the analysis.
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model implementation and label encoding.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization (e.g., histograms, scatter plots).

Methodology-
Data Cleaning and Preparation
Missing Values Handling: Address missing values using mean imputation or deletion as appropriate.
Feature Engineering: Create new metrics (e.g., player efficiency ratings) to enhance predictions.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-
Statistical Summary: Utilize describe() to assess key statistics and detect anomalies.
Player Segmentation: Analyze distributions of key metrics to identify player roles and types.

Model Development-
Feature Selection: Use techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Algorithm Selection: Test classifiers such as Decision Trees, SVM, and Random Forests.

Model Evaluation and Refinement-
Cross-validation: Perform k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization-
Feature Importance: Highlight influential features.
Classification Results: Visualize category-wise player segmentation.

Expected Outcomes-
Classification Model: An accurate classifier for NBA player categorization.
Strategic Insights: Actionable insights to aid teams in player evaluation, recruitment, and strategy.
